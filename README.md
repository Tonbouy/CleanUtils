The need for this toolkit came from always reusing the same base classes and extensions in all projects to implement Clean Architecture with a clean usage of viewModels, dataStates

CleanUtils was mainly designed to be included in most projects which is why classes leave space for customization in extensions.

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

- RxSwift
- RxCocoa

## Installation

CleanUtils is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
